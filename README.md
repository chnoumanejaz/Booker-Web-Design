# Booker-Web-Design ðŸ˜‰
The website which basically allow the user to book many of the things from just a single site. (It's just a design)
You have to run it on the live server. I used svg images that are not able to load locally.
So, to run open project directory and apply following commands:

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
This basically install all the files that are required.

### `npm run start`
This Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any errors in the console.

### `npm run build`
After completing the code simply type this the project build will run and make the css files.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
